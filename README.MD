# 1st challenge - Horiseon Marketing Page
<p>
The first challenge involved refactoring an existing wepbage for a market firm called Horiseon. My task was to take the existing code and optimize it for SEO standards, structure the code into a more sensible flow, replace Divs with proper semantic language, create IDs that would link to sections of the same page and puplish the page online via github. </p>
